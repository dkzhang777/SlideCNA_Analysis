# SlideCNA Analysis

This repository contains vignettes to guide you in reproducing SlideCNA results from our manuscript and to get you started on implementing SlideCNA on your own Slide-seq-like spatial transcriptomics datasets. We demonstrate SlideCNA usage on two Slide-seq datasets on three modes: spatial, non-spatial (for non-spatial transcriptomics single cell-like data), and spatial with bead splitting via [TACCO](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01657-3).

For more information about the SlideCNA workflow, please refer to documentation here: https://github.com/dkzhang777/SlideCNA .

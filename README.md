# SlideCNA Analysis

Here are vignettes to guide you in reproducing SlideCNA results from our manuscript and to get you started on implementing SlideCNA on your own Slide-seq-like spatial transcriptomics datasets. We demonstrate SlideCNA usage on two Slide-seq datasets on two modes: spatial and non-spatial (for non-spatial transcriptomics single cell-like data).

For more information about the SlideCNA workflow, please refer to documentation here: https://github.com/dkzhang777/SlideCNA .
